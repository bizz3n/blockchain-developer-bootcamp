# Dapp University token
This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deplohys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply list the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

````shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
